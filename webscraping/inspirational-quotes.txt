There is one spectacle grander than the sea, that is the sky; there is one spectacle grander than the sky, that is the interior of the soul
Whatever the soul knows how to seek, it cannot fail to obtain
Strong is the soul, kind, and wise, and beautiful
To practice any art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow
The soul should always stand ajar, ready to welcome the ecstatic experience
Patience and perseverance have a magical effect before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish
The key to everything is patience
Have patience
Patience is not simply the ability to wait - it's how we behave while we're waiting
Adopt the pace of nature: her secret is patience
I will sprinkle compliments and uplifting words everywhere I go
Sincere compliments cost nothing and can accomplish much
If you see someone and they strike you as beautiful in any way, why not let them know? #<Author:0x007f0fb125a158>
I can live for two months on a good compliment
There is no effect more disproportionate to its cause than the happiness bestowed by a small compliment
And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places
